The month was a difficult comparison because sales jumped in June of last year as dealers offered discounts to push models that risked becoming redundant with new emission standards taking effect shortly.
SUV sales were up 1.2% in June to 766K units. Sales of new energy vehicles (battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) fell 35% to 85.6K.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) accounted for 23% of all pure electric sales during the month with a tally of 14,954 Model 3s sold. Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) gained market share during the month with a 4.5% increase and Geely Automobile (OTCPK:GELYF) posted strong growth of 21.0%.

"Yesterday, 3:48 PM",Sunrun deal for Vivint to top Tesla as rooftop solar juggernaut,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3589237-sunrun-deal-for-vivint-to-top-tesla-rooftop-solar-juggernaut?source=content_type:react|section:News|sectionAsset:News|first_level_url:symbol|button:Title|lock_status:No|line:2,"Sunrun (RUN +23.9%) surges to all-time highs after it agreed to acquire Vivint Solar (VSLR +38.4%) in an all-stock deal valued at $3.2B including debt.
The combination forms a company that would overtake Tesla's (TSLA +1.4%) residential solar business in scale: Last year Tesla accounted for 14% of all U.S. residential solar installations, while Sunrun and Vivint together accounted for 16%, according to UBS Research.
The immediate cost synergy the companies announced seems underwhelming at $90M/year, but the hope is that their larger scale eventually will help Sunrun tackle ""soft costs"" such as labor, permits and customer acquisition, writes Jinjoo Lee for WSJ's Heard On The Street.
Even as hardware costs for residential solar systems have declined over the years, the companies' overhead has remained flat, so soft costs accounted for 64% of residential solar overall costs as of Q1, up from 52% in 2014, according to Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association.

"Yesterday, 10:21 AM",Tesla bears capitulate for the near term,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3589120-tesla-bears-capitulate-for-near-term?source=content_type:react|section:News|sectionAsset:News|first_level_url:symbol|button:Title|lock_status:No|line:3,"The bear camp on Tesla (TSLA +0.4%) is cracking a bit under the pressure of a share price rally of 146% over 90 days.
""While we still believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued, we see nothing to prevent the shares moving higher in the coming weeks,"" notes Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. He thinks the negative data points may not arrive until Q4.
""Our long-term concerns remain, but are not seen as tangible or near-term to stop the rally,"" chimes in Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas. He says the firm is struggling to play catch-up, although the MS base case price target was raised to $740 and the bull case PT sent up to $2,070. ""Our concerns around sustainability of profit in China, poor auto industry fundamentals, and what we believe to be inevitable competition in EVs and AVs from a host of well capitalized tech firms (AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL, etc.) are just not seen by the market as a big enough part of the narrative for the remainder of 2020,"" sums up Jonas on the great Tesla re-rating.
Meanwhile, Automotive News is also entering the fray, with an editorial today warning that ""overexcited"" fans should cool down a little and strap in for the long game.

The next big event for Tesla is Q2 earnings. Here are how the consensus estimate stacks up for that quarter and the following.

"Mon, Jul. 06",Tesla market cap crown brings focus on valuation,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3588818-tesla-market-cap-crown-brings-focus-on-valuation?source=content_type:react|section:News|sectionAsset:News|first_level_url:symbol|button:Title|lock_status:No|line:4,"Tesla shares got a lot of hype last week as the company passed Toyota Motor as the most valuable automaker.
Tesla (TSLA, +10%) now boasts a market capitalization of a little more than $224 billion. Toyota (TM, +0.1%) has a market cap of around $205 billion if you count the $30 billion it holds of its own shares (treasury shares) because of its buyback program. That’s about 14% of the shares outstanding, according to Bloomberg. Without those shares, Toyota’s market cap is about $174 billion, eclipsed by Tesla back in the middle of June.
But if anyone were looking to buy either company, Toyota would cost more. Its enterprise value (market cap plus debt minus cash and equivalents), also considered the takeover price, is about $337.5 billion. That’s due to Toyota’s net debt of more than $157 billion. Tesla’s enterprise value is about $232.7 billion, with just a little more than $7.1 billion in debt.
With shares up nearly 200% year to date, Tesla gets a failing quant grade on just about every valuation metric relative to the Consumer Discretionary sector (it gets a C- on forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings-growth and a D- on enterprise value vs. forward EBITDA). Toyota gets a B- overall and an A on price to forward cash flow and price to trailing GAAP earnings. Its shares are down about 10% for the year so far.
On momentum, Tesla shines with an overall rating of A+. Over the last month the stock is up more than 37%, compared with a 1.6% rise in the S&P. Toyota, which gets an overall C for momentum, is down slightly over the last month.
That momentum in Tesla is visible today as shares are up more than 10% following a price target boost from J.P. Morgan. But the raise in the price target to $295 from $275, based on the improved second-quarter deliveries of 90,650, came with a caution as J.P. Morgan kept its Underweight rating on the stock.
“Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition,” analysts wrote in a note today. “Meanwhile, valuation appears to be pricing in upside related to expansion into mass-market segments well beyond our volume forecasts for the Model 3.”
But J.P. Morgan also did highlight upside risks to its valuation of the company. 
Those include: “(1) The demand for Tesla vehicles could rise materially beyond our expectations; (2) gasoline prices could increase or government penalties and regulations on rival internal combustion engine vehicles could increase, which could drive adoption toward electric vehicles, benefitting Tesla; and (3) better than expected execution on operating targets.”
The high valuation of Tesla vs. Toyota comes down to the view of the future of the auto industry. Shares are still attractive if you believe that electric will become the standard sooner rather than later, with Tesla sitting in pole position for EVs.
Reuters noted today that petroleum consumption has been slowing since the early 1970s and that trend looks set to continue through the 2020s and the 2030s. But at present there is no shortage of crude, even with OPEC limiting production and U.S. shale players on the sideline until prices improve. The decline in air travel due to the pandemic could keep gasoline prices depressed as refiners shift the mix in products away from jet fuel.

""If the company can manage 90K units during an extraordinarily challenging quarter, there is no reason that TSLA cannot be shipping 130K to 140K units a quarter by the end of the year in our opinion,"" advises the firm.
Looking further ahead, JMP thinks Tesla is on track to record revenue of $100B by 2025, which is quite a step up from the last few years.
JMP assigns a price target of $1,500 to Tesla.
Shares of Tesla are up 6.19% premarket to $1,283.40 as they give every indication that the 2020 rally will extend today.

A pair of the limited edition red satin shorts are now being sold at the Tesla Shop for $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk's infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share.
As of mid-June, more than 15M shares of TSLA stock were being sold short and are currently valued at more than $18B, making Tesla by far the most shorted company by valuation on the Nasdaq.
'Short Shorts' could also hint at second quarter results. Tesla's lack of profitability has been an argument of Tesla short sellers for years and the company would not likely release this kind of item at the conclusion of an unprofitable quarter.
Turning a profit for Q2 would see the company eligible for inclusion on the S&P 500, which requires a minimum of four consecutive quarters of profitability.

Usually, the day before Independence Day is low on volume, a combination of investors leaving work early to get a jump on the holiday and those taking more time off to travel to see friends and relatives. But with many working remotely, there’s no traffic to beat, and staycations will likely be the order of the day.
Focus would also be on gas prices and demand as the summer driving season hits high gear. Still, the week does provide some catalysts for the auto sector.
June auto and truck sales arrive on Wednesday, and reopening in some states could juice the expected recovery some. J.D. Power and LMC Automotive predict that total vehicle sales this month fell 25%, a smaller decline than 29% in May and the low drop of 40% for April.
A problem to the rebound could be incentives drying up, with automakers able to only offer so much. Incentives are on a pace to hit $4,411, which would be a record for June and up $445 from the same month a year ago.
The same day, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report its quarterly deliveries - one of the toughest periods to gauge given that factories were shut and then started up again. The consensus is for 69K in Q2, but analysts have been upping their forecasts.
“Investors would like to see actual numbers out of China, although management might not provide that much transparency,” Bill Maurer wrote on Seeking Alpha Friday. 
Maurer forecasts 89,830 vehicles delivered, which would be “a decline of more than 6,000 vehicles over Q2 2019, despite Tesla having opened the Shanghai factory since then, as well as launching the Model Y this year.”
Thanks mainly to Tesla, the First Trust Nasdaq Global Auto Index Fund (NASDAQ:CARZ) is up more than 50% from its April lows of the year.
Lucky Numbers?
Casino stocks were one of the first groups affected when COVID-19 began to spread from Wuhan, and they are still feeling the swings of the pandemic more than most. 
The group took the brunt of the rollback on reopening measures in some states. Nevada was not among them, but the state decided to require masks after a spike in cases.
With shares whipsawed between optimism on reopening and pessimism about a second wave of COVID-19, any solid data could help direction.
On Tuesday, the Nevada Gaming Control Board issues its monthly report on revenue and collections, also known as the win report. May saw a plunge of 99.6% in gaming win to about $3.65M. With casinos only reopening in June, a similarly dismal number is expected, but it can give investors some insight into how the companies managed their digital sports betting operations to get some revenue.
On Wednesday the numbers from Macau arrive. Those casinos have remained open aside from a mandatory shutdown in February. But revenue and activity have been way down due to the two-week quarantine required for visitors to the island. This month, Macau ordered that travelers from Beijing cannot self-quarantine but must go to official quarantine locations, due to the spike of cases in the city.

Traditional and hybrid versions of the pickup are scheduled to be unveiled and the all-electric version is seen coming sometime in the next two years - in line or slightly later than new electric pickups from GM (NYSE:GM), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Rivian and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA).
Reports suggest the new F-Series will feature a lay-flat ""sleeper seat"" that mimics a first-class airline experience, Sync 4 infotainment with over-the-air update capabilities and a larger touch screen.
Putting it in perspective: Almost 900K F-Series pickups sold last year to generate about $42B in revenue, ranking near the iPhone among the biggest U.S. consumer products. On its own, F-Series is larger than McDonald's, Nike, Coca-Cola and Starbucks, and supports roughly half a million jobs.
""Stock performance over five years has been miserable, setting the stage for a rebound if current Ford management can optimize F150's cash and profit producing potential,"" writes Doron Levin in a Seeking Alpha article published before the launch.

Value stocks, which have been out of vogue, saw brief resurgence in May, but most of that evaporated in June.

Tech stocks will continue to outperform, they say, while stocks with weak balance sheets have recovered far less during the recent value rally.
Main Street euphoria is at least to some extent responsible for the market's wild V-turn. This week, we should get more visibility into whether Main Street will defend its buying with more buying, or whether it will panic and drive prices lower.

When asked what do technology investors think of Tesla, Huberty says they see an incredibly innovative company in a category that needs a spurt of innovation. ""If there’s a path to profitability and reason to believe scale will continue to increase, then tech investors tend to not care as much about valuation and/or are willing to look multiple years into the future when scale and profitability will support current valuation,"" she observes.

The lawsuit was seen as a gesture by some observers because Tesla did not ask for a temporary restraining order, which could have allowed it to legally proceed with vehicle manufacturing.

Jonas also weighs in on competition from big tech names with a fresh angle.
""We often hear from investors that Tesla could potentially be the Amazon of transportation. But what if Amazon is the Amazon of transportation? After all, AMZN spends nearly $40bn/year on shipping and has made some rather bold moves in controlling its own destiny in sustainable delivery, including substantial financial backing of Rivian and an order for 100k electric delivery vans to be deployed between 2021 and 2024. Admittedly, conspicuous competitive threats from large tech platforms (such as, but not limited to, AMZN, Apple, Alphabet, etc.) may take several years to come to fruition; we believe the signs of progress will be increasingly evident and that investors will pay greater attention to them.""

There is still some work to be done by Tesla with analysts on average expected a Q2 loss of $387M, although a backlog of inventory now being delivered could help. The impact of furloughing employees and potential rent deferrals could also factor in to the EPS print.
Former Aegon Asset Management CEO Gary Black thinks it's a 100% probability that S&P would add Tesla to the index if it meets the profit requirement.

Analyst Paul Gong and team also think the long-range version price unveiled on April 10 might have shifted demand towards long-range ones, while the EV automaker produced too many standard-range ones.
The government subsidy standard change announced on April 23 is also believed to have kept some customers waiting for a price cut.
""To some degree, the difference can possibly also be explained by Tesla's volatile monthly deliveries that usually peak in the last month of the quarter and hit a low in the first month.""
Looking ahead, UBS thinks the most logic reaction for Tesla would be to cut prices in China, given its costs have declined significantly after localization thanks to cheaper component, capex and labor than in the U.S.

David Einhorn and gang lament that seemingly overpriced ""story stocks"" outperformed during the quarter. Greenlight lost 37% on longs, made 8% on shorts and made 8% in macro during the quarter.
Looking ahead, Greenlight sees large deficits naturally leading to inflation after the post-pandemic recovery begins.
""We believe the implied negative real interest rates are bullish for gold and for unlevered real assets with pricing power (home prices will rise, while leveraged commercial real estate will fall from lack of demand).""
On Brighthouse Financial (NASDAQ:BHF): ""Today, BHF is worth a total of... $2.5 billion. That’s right – all of the rest of the company is close to free. We expect the hedges will come through, and BHF will likely report GAAP earnings in the first quarter that approach its current market cap.3 BHF is not in financial distress. Its investment grade-rated 2027 bonds trade at 96% to yield 4.4%.""
On Green Brick Partners (NASDAQ:GRBK): ""While the decline in home sales due to the slowdown will impact earnings later this year, we believe that single family housing will emerge as a post-pandemic secular winner, as low interest rates support housing and people’s preferences are likely to shift toward detached homes over multifamily residences.""
On AerCap (NYSE:AER): ""AER stock has fallen much further than an index of global airline equities, which, given AER’s comparatively lower risk profile, seems unjustified.

On General Motors (NYSE:GM): ""We had expected a strong bounce back in earnings and cash flow in 2020, but the annual guidance, while meeting Wall Street expectations, was worse than we expected. Further, the cash burned during the strike needed to be re-earned in order to protect GM’s investment grade rating.""
On Tempur Sealy (NYSE:TPX): ""Tempur Sealy beat revenue estimates last quarter by 17% and the stock made an all-time high. We used the strength to exit near the top.""
On Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): ""The TSLA melt-up from $418 at year end to a high of $969 on February 4 caused only a moderate loss, as much of our short position was structured in put spreads.

Wall Street takes from a bull, a bear and a firm playing it down the middle are below.
Oppenheimer (Outperform, $968 price target): ""Given what we believe is an important incremental validation of TSLA's ability to disrupt the auto market, we are expanding our earnings multiple to 40x (from 30x) as we see potential for TSLA to continue growing at accelerated rates through the end of the decade... TSLA guided Shanghai capacity to 4,000/week (200K/year) by mid-2020 and achieving cost savings throughout its ramp due to higher utilization along with increased localization of the supply chain. Management also announced a price reduction, allowing TSLA to continue receiving EV subsidies in China after June. We remain constructive on demand for TSLA in China especially considering the competitive landscape.""
Wedbush (Neutral, $600 price target): ""In terms of guidance, Tesla did not give investors much saying it would revisit 2020 guidance when it reports 2Q results, that the 500K unit delivery number remains ""uncertain"" given production capabilities, and that Cash flow as well as profitability guidance is ""on hold"", which makes sense in this uncertain environment with Fremont still shutdown. With the second half of March seeing a screeching halt in demand across the globe given the current pandemic, the big question for investors continues to be around the demand trajectory for 2Q and when the flagship Fremont factory reopens given the current SF lockdown. To this point, clearly Musk is very frustrated by the current stay-at-home order and voiced those opinions loud and clear on the conference call especially as its main artery in Fremont remains in shutdown mode.""
JPMorgan (Underweight, $240 price target): ""We see a number of more important takeaways, including: (1) unexpectedly higher (and typically lumpy) regulatory credits of $354 mn in 1Q (a new record and nearly 3x the average of the last three quarters) vs. consensus $172 mn and JPM $100 mn accounted for 44% of the $418 mn EBIT beat vs. consensus and 53% of the $254 mn EBIT beat vs. JPM (without the credits, adjusted EBIT would have been a loss of -$71 mn vs. the reported +$283 mn); (2) a number of initiatives once seen as important to the narrative of Tesla as a hyper growth company deserving of extraordinarily high valuation multiples (e.g., 355x Bloomberg consensus 2020 EPS, 49x EBITDA, 15x price/book, etc.) were pushed out — the Tesla Semi (unveiled in 2017 and originally planned for 2019 before first being pushed to 2020) was pushed out again yesterday to 2021, and the call at the Tesla Autonomous Day on April 22, 2019 for 1 million fully autonomous robo-taxis to be on the road.""

Ives notes that the consensus expectation for 97.3K deliveries during the quarter is artificially high, with many sell-side firms yet to adjust their projections to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China, Europe and the U.S. The early Q2 deliveries projections are also just as stale.
Tesla typically issues its quarterly deliveries report during the first few days of the new quarter (April 1-April 3).
Looking further ahead, Tesla now appears extremely unlikely to hit the +500K unit delivery threshold for the full year with the Fremont factory shut down for at least a month. ""While cash burn will be heightened in the near term due to this anomalous global situation, we believe the longer-term trends remain very healthy and $20 of annual earnings power down the road is achievable and still remains the target bogey to hit over the coming years for Musk & Co.,"" writes Ives on the road ahead for Tesla.
Wedbush has a Neutral rating on Tesla and a price target of $425.
